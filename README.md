Foursquare Check-in Challenge - HackPrinceton 2013
==============

The following repository was created for foursquare to have challenges for those who check in with the foursquare service. The premise is that people can competitively check in, and see who gets the most points in these challenges that users make.

Team members included Huy, Quentin, Aihoa, Kenneth, Raymond, and Dennis.

Idea: People use foursquare to check-in. With the dynamic web service, people may log into the site and sign into their foursquare. The site automatically updates the check-ins that the user has updated via their phone. On the web service, users may create check-in challenges to compete with friends or strangers in a themed challenge within a period of time. You get points, and you can compare yourself with people within the check-in challenge.
